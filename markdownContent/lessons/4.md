# Computational Thinking in Linguistics: Solving Real Problems

## What is Computational Thinking?

Computational thinking helps us solve complex problems by using four key strategies:

1. **Decomposition**: Breaking big problems into smaller, manageable pieces
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Finding similarities or patterns that can help solve the problem
3. **Abstraction**: Focusing on the important information and ignoring irrelevant details
4. **Algorithmic Thinking**: Creating step-by-step solutions that can be followed exactly

Let's see how these strategies work in practice!

## Real Problem: Analyzing Word Patterns in Text

> **Problem**: A linguist wants to understand how words are used in different texts. They need to count words, compare texts, and find patterns.

### Computational Thinking in Action

#### Step 1: Decomposition (Breaking Down the Problem)

Let's break this big problem into smaller pieces:
```
Big Problem: "Analyze word patterns in text"
â†“
Smaller Problems:
1. How do we handle text input?
2. How do we process words?
3. How do we count words?
4. How do we show results?
```

#### Step 2: Pattern Recognition (What's Similar?)

Let's identify patterns in how we process text:
```
Pattern 1: Text Cleaning
- All texts need lowercase conversion
- All texts need punctuation removed
- All texts need to be split into words

Pattern 2: Word Counting
- Each word either exists or doesn't in our count
- If it exists, increase count
- If it doesn't exist, start counting from 1
```

#### Step 3: Abstraction (What's Important?)

For word counting, we only care about:

- The words themselves (not their position)
- How many times each word appears
- The cleaned version of the text

We can ignore:

- Punctuation
- Letter case (uppercase/lowercase)
- Extra spaces
- Original text formatting

#### Step 4: Algorithmic Solution

Now let's write code that follows our thinking process:

```python
def count_words(text):
    # Step 1: Clean the text
    text = text.lower()  # Make all letters lowercase
    
    # Step 2: Remove punctuation
    for punctuation in ".,!?":
        text = text.replace(punctuation, "")
    
    # Step 3: Split into words
    words = text.split()  # Split on spaces
    
    # Step 4: Count words
    word_counts = {}  # Empty dictionary to store counts
    for word in words:
        if word in word_counts:
            word_counts[word] = word_counts[word] + 1
        else:
            word_counts[word] = 1
    
    return word_counts

# Test with a simple example
sample_text = "I love programming. I love Python!"
results = count_words(sample_text)

# Show results
print("Word counts:")
for word, count in results.items():
    print(f"'{word}' appears {count} times")
```

### Making Our Solution Better

Let's improve our solution to handle more complex cases:

```python
def analyze_text(text):
    # Words to ignore
    common_words = ["the", "and", "in", "to", "a"]
    
    # Clean text
    text = text.lower()
    words = text.split()
    
    # Count important words
    word_counts = {}
    for word in words:
        if word not in common_words:  # Skip common words
            # Group similar words (e.g., cat/cats)
            if word.endswith('s'):
                word = word[:-1]
                
            # Count the word
            if word in word_counts:
                word_counts[word] += 1
            else:
                word_counts[word] = 1
    
    return word_counts

# Test with a more complex example
text = """
The cats are playing in the garden.
A cat is sleeping under the tree.
Many cats enjoy sunny days.
"""

results = analyze_text(text)
print("\nAnalysis results:")
for word, count in results.items():
    print(f"'{word}' appears {count} times")
```

## Practice Problems

1. **Simple Word Counter**: 
   Write a program that counts how many times each word appears in a text.

2. **Pattern Finder**: 
   Find all words that start with a specific letter in a text.

3. **Text Comparison**: 
   Compare two texts to find words they have in common.

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Break Down Problems**:
   - Start with the big problem
   - Split it into smaller pieces
   - Solve one piece at a time

2. **Look for Patterns**:
   - Find similar tasks
   - Group related items
   - Reuse solutions

3. **Focus on What's Important**:
   - Decide what information you need
   - Ignore unnecessary details
   - Keep solutions simple

4. **Write Clear Steps**:
   - Make each step clear
   - Test with simple examples
   - Build up to harder problems

## Try It Yourself!

1. Break the problem down
2. Look for patterns
3. Focus on what's important
4. Write clear steps
5. Test and improve your solution
