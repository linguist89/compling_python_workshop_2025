# Computational Thinking Exercises

## Exercise 1: Breaking Down Problems
You want to find all the different animals mentioned in a story. Break this problem into smaller steps and write code for each step.

Use this story:
```python
story = """
The cat and dog were playing in the garden.
A bird was watching from the tree.
Two fish were swimming in the pond.
The cat tried to catch the bird, but the dog stopped it.
"""
```

1. How would you break this problem into smaller parts?
2. Write code to solve each part
3. Put all parts together to find all animals

## Exercise 2: Finding Patterns
Look at these three sentences:
```python
text1 = "The happy cat plays with the red ball"
text2 = "The hungry dog runs after the blue toy"
text3 = "The sleepy bird flies to the green tree"
```

1. What patterns do you see in these sentences?
2. Write a program that can find:
   - The describing word (happy, hungry, sleepy)
   - The animal (cat, dog, bird)
   - The action (plays, runs, flies)
   - The color (red, blue, green)
   - The object (ball, toy, tree)

## Exercise 3: Word Groups
Write a program that groups similar words together. For example:
- play, plays, playing → play
- cat, cats → cat
- run, runs, running → run

Test your program with this text:
```python
text = """
The cats are playing in the garden.
The dog runs and plays with the cats.
A bird is flying over the running dog.
Many dogs like playing games.
"""
```

Hint: Look at word endings!

## Exercise 4: Text Comparison
Compare two short stories and find:
1. Words that appear in both stories
2. Words that only appear in the first story
3. Words that only appear in the second story

Use these stories:
```python
story1 = """
The cat sat on the mat.
It was a sunny day.
The cat was happy.
"""

story2 = """
The dog sat in the garden.
It was a rainy day.
The dog was excited.
"""
```

## Exercise 5: Word Counter
Create a program that:
1. Removes common words (like "the", "and", "in")
2. Counts how many times each word appears
3. Shows the top 3 most used words

Test it with this text:
```python
text = """
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The dog watches the fox jump.
The fox and dog play in the garden.
The quick fox runs away.
"""
```

## Bonus Challenge
Create a simple program that can find rhyming words in a poem. Two words rhyme if they end with the same letters.

Try it with this poem:
```python
poem = """
The cat on the mat
Saw a rat in a hat
It was fat and flat
What do you think of that?
"""
```

Remember:
1. Break each problem into smaller parts
2. Look for patterns that can help you
3. Focus on the important information
4. Write clear steps to solve each part
5. Test your code with simple examples first
