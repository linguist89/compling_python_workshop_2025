# String and List Manipulation

Your task is to create a program that processes a list of book titles and their publication years. This exercise will test your understanding of strings, lists, and basic data types.

## Input Data

```python
books = [
    "The Great Gatsby (1925)",
    "To Kill a Mockingbird (1960)", 
    "1984 (1949)",
    "Pride and Prejudice (1813)"
]
```

## Requirements

1. Extract the title and year from each book entry
2. Create a new list of formatted strings that follow this pattern: "Title: {book_title} - Published: {year}"
3. Sort the list by publication year (newest to oldest)
4. Print only the books published after 1900

## Expected Output

```
Title: To Kill a Mockingbird - Published: 1960
Title: 1984 - Published: 1949
Title: The Great Gatsby - Published: 1925
```

## Tips

- Think about string methods you learned (split, strip)
- Consider using list comprehension
- Remember how to convert strings to integers
- Use sorting with a key function

## Solution Approach

1. First, you'll need to parse each book entry to separate the title from the year
2. The year is always in parentheses at the end of each string
3. You can use string slicing and strip() to get clean title and year values
4. Convert years to integers for proper sorting
5. Use list comprehension to create the formatted output strings
6. Filter the results to only show books after 1900
