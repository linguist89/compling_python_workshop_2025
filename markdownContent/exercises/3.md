# COVID-19 Data Analysis

Create a program that analyzes and visualizes COVID-19 vaccination data across different countries. This exercise will test your understanding of Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Input Data

```python
# Sample of the vaccination_data.csv content:
# country,population,total_vaccinations,people_vaccinated,people_fully_vaccinated,date
# USA,331002651,608958925,261227655,223937566,2023-01-01
# UK,67886011,204274906,53644078,50500985,2023-01-01
# Canada,37742154,93585028,32984811,31499915,2023-01-01
# Australia,25499884,63421877,22138165,21143667,2023-01-01
```

## Requirements

1. Load and process the vaccination data using Pandas
2. Calculate and add new columns for:
   - Vaccination rate (people_fully_vaccinated / population)
   - Partial vaccination rate (people_vaccinated / population)
3. Create two visualizations:
   - Bar plot comparing vaccination rates across countries
   - Scatter plot showing relationship between population and total vaccinations
4. Add proper labels, titles, and legends to the plots
5. Save the processed data and plots to files

## Expected Output

### Console Output
```
Vaccination Analysis Summary:
---------------------------
Top 3 Countries by Vaccination Rate:
1. Canada: 83.46%
2. UK: 74.39%
3. Australia: 82.92%

Average Vaccination Rate: 77.56%
Total Population Covered: 462,130,700
```

### Generated Files
- `processed_vaccination_data.csv` (Processed DataFrame with new columns)
- `vaccination_rates.png` (Bar plot)
- `population_vs_vaccinations.png` (Scatter plot)

### Plot Requirements

1. Bar Plot:
   - X-axis: Countries
   - Y-axis: Vaccination Rate (%)
   - Different colors for full and partial vaccination
   - Title: "COVID-19 Vaccination Rates by Country"
   - Legend showing "Fully Vaccinated" and "Partially Vaccinated"

2. Scatter Plot:
   - X-axis: Population (in millions)
   - Y-axis: Total Vaccinations (in millions)
   - Each point labeled with country name
   - Title: "Population vs Total Vaccinations"
   - Trend line showing correlation

## Tips

- Use Pandas' read_csv() for data loading
- Remember to handle data cleaning (missing values, data types)
- Use DataFrame operations for calculations
- Consider using different Matplotlib plot styles
- Pay attention to data formatting (percentages, millions)
- Use plt.savefig() for saving plots

## Solution Approach

1. Import and set up required libraries (pandas, matplotlib)
2. Load and clean the data, handling any missing values
3. Calculate vaccination rates and add new columns
4. Create the bar plot:
   - Set up figure and axes
   - Plot both full and partial vaccination rates
   - Add labels and legend
5. Create the scatter plot:
   - Convert values to millions for better readability
   - Add trend line using numpy's polyfit
   - Add country labels to points
6. Save the processed data and plots
7. Generate and display the summary statistics
