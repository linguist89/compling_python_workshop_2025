# Grade Calculator

Create a program that processes student grades and generates a summary report. This exercise will test your understanding of functions, loops, conditionals, and error handling.

## Input Data

```python
student_grades = [
    {"name": "Alice", "grades": [85, 92, 78, 95, 88]},
    {"name": "Bob", "grades": [72, 65, 80, "N/A", 75]},
    {"name": "Charlie", "grades": [91, 88, 93, 87]},
    {"name": "Diana", "grades": [64, 70, "absent", 81, 77]},
]
```

## Requirements

1. Create a function that calculates the average grade for a student, handling:
   - Missing grades ("N/A" or "absent" should be ignored)
   - Invalid grades (non-numeric values)
2. Generate a report that includes:
   - Student name
   - Average grade (rounded to 2 decimal places)
   - Letter grade based on the average:
     * A: 90-100
     * B: 80-89
     * C: 70-79
     * D: 60-69
     * F: Below 60
3. Sort the report by average grade (highest to lowest)
4. Include error handling for invalid data

## Expected Output

```
Student Grade Report:
------------------
Charlie - Average: 89.75 (B)
Alice - Average: 87.60 (B)
Bob - Average: 73.00 (C)
Diana - Average: 73.00 (C)

Errors Encountered:
- Invalid grade found for Bob: 'N/A'
- Invalid grade found for Diana: 'absent'
```

## Tips

- Use try/except blocks for error handling
- Consider using functions with type hints
- Think about how to handle missing or invalid data
- Use string formatting for clean output
- Consider using a dictionary for grade letter mapping

## Solution Approach

1. Create a helper function to convert grades to numbers and handle invalid values
2. Implement the average calculation function with error handling
3. Create a function to determine letter grades based on numerical averages
4. Process each student's grades and collect error messages
5. Sort the results by average grade
6. Format and display the final report
